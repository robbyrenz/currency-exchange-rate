# Foreign Currency Exchange Rate
A website that was built with Flask in the backend that lets the user find out the most recent exchange rate for the currencies GBP (Great British Pound), AUD (Austrailian Dollar), CAD (Canadian Dollar), PLN (Polish Zioty), and MXN (Mexican Peso) from EUR (Euro). This Python program uses the Fixer API in order to get the latest conversion rates.
